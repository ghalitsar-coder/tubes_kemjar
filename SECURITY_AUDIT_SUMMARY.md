# Security Audit Summary - Healthcare Application

## Overview

This document summarizes the security improvements made to the Next.js healthcare application with Clerk authentication, Prisma database, and Hono API framework.

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Migration Endpoint Security ✅

**File:** `/api/migrate/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- Exposed database migration functionality without authentication
- Could be accessed by any user in development

**Fixes:**

- Added admin-only authentication using `requireAdmin()`
- Added environment-based restrictions with `isDebugAllowed()`
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added proper response structure with timestamps

### 2. User Management Endpoints ✅

**Files:** `/api/users/route.ts`, `/api/users/[id]/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- No authentication required to view all users
- Exposed sensitive user data
- Allowed creating users without proper validation
- Plain text password storage
- User updates/deletes without authorization

**Fixes:**

- Added admin-only access for user listing
- Implemented proper authentication for all operations
- Added bcrypt password hashing
- Implemented input validation with Zod schemas
- Added rate limiting (10 requests/minute for creation, 20 for viewing)
- Added authorization checks (users can only modify their own data or admin required)
- Prevented admins from deleting themselves

### 3. Admin Database Test Endpoint ✅

**File:** `/api/admin/database-test/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- Used hardcoded secrets for authentication
- No proper admin verification
- No rate limiting

**Fixes:**

- Replaced hardcoded secrets with proper admin authentication
- Added environment-based restrictions
- Implemented rate limiting (5 GET, 3 POST requests/minute)
- Enhanced database statistics gathering
- Added proper error handling and response structure

### 4. Posts Management ✅

**File:** `/api/posts/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- POST endpoint allowed creating posts for any authorId
- Insufficient input validation
- No rate limiting

**Fixes:**

- Fixed authorization to only allow users to create posts as themselves
- Added input validation with Zod schemas
- Implemented rate limiting (30 GET, 10 POST requests/minute)
- Enhanced error handling and response structure

### 5. Doctors Endpoint ✅

**File:** `/api/doctors/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- No authentication required
- Exposed sensitive medical data
- No input validation for query parameters
- No limits on data retrieval

**Fixes:**

- Added authentication requirement for all users
- Limited exposed user data (removed sensitive information like emails)
- Added query parameter validation
- Implemented default limits (50 doctors max per request)
- Added rate limiting (20 requests/minute)
- Enhanced security with proper field selection

### 6. Medical Specialties ✅

**File:** `/api/specialties/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- No rate limiting on public endpoint
- Could be abused for DoS attacks

**Fixes:**

- Added rate limiting (50 requests/minute for public access)
- Limited exposed fields to only necessary data
- Enhanced error handling and response structure

### 7. Doctor Patients Endpoint ✅

**File:** `/api/doctors/patients/route.ts`
**Issues:**

- Basic authentication but could benefit from additional security

**Fixes:**

- Wrapped with security middleware
- Added rate limiting (20 requests/minute)
- Limited exposed patient data in list view
- Enhanced response structure
- Improved error handling

## Security Middleware Implementation ✅

### Rate Limiting

- Implemented per-endpoint rate limiting
- Different limits based on endpoint sensitivity:
  - Public endpoints: 50 requests/minute
  - User data viewing: 20 requests/minute
  - User data modification: 10 requests/minute
  - Admin operations: 3-5 requests/minute

### Input Validation

- Implemented Zod schemas for all user inputs
- Validates data types, lengths, and formats
- Prevents injection attacks through proper validation

### Authentication & Authorization

- Clerk authentication for all protected endpoints
- Role-based access control (PATIENT, DOCTOR, ADMIN)
- Proper authorization checks before data access
- Admin-only restrictions for sensitive operations

### Environment-Based Security

- Debug endpoints disabled in production
- Environment variable checks for sensitive operations
- Proper configuration validation

## Remaining Security Considerations

### 1. Additional Endpoints to Review

- `/api/appointments/[id]/route.ts` - Individual appointment access
- `/api/doctors/schedule/route.ts` - Doctor schedule management
- `/api/doctors/[doctorId]/availability/route.ts` - Doctor availability
- Webhook endpoints - Ensure proper signature validation

### 2. Database Security

- Ensure all database queries use Prisma (prevent raw SQL injection)
- Implement proper database connection pooling
- Add database query logging for security monitoring

### 3. Logging & Monitoring

- Implement comprehensive security logging
- Add failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity patterns
- Log all admin operations

### 4. Additional Security Headers

- Implement CORS policies
- Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Ensure proper content type validation

### 5. Secret Management

- Review all environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper secret rotation policies
- Use secure secret storage solutions

## Security Best Practices Implemented ✅

1. **Authentication First**: All sensitive endpoints require authentication
2. **Authorization Checks**: Users can only access their own data unless admin
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
5. **Secure Password Handling**: bcrypt for password hashing
6. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses without sensitive data leakage
7. **Logging**: Proper error logging for debugging and security monitoring
8. **Environment Separation**: Debug features disabled in production

## Dependencies Added

- `bcryptjs`: For secure password hashing
- Enhanced security middleware with comprehensive protection

## Next Steps

1. Complete security review of remaining endpoints
2. Implement comprehensive logging system
3. Add automated security testing
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Conduct penetration testing
6. Regular security audits and updates
